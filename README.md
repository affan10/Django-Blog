# Blog in Django 3.0.5 and Python 3.6.9

This blog was developed as a practice for understanding Python's Django Web Framework. The blog was built and 
designed via The Net Ninja's Django Blog tutorial. After completing his tutorial, I added more functionality 
to it and improved the blog's overall User Experience.

Additional functionality includes:
- Serving BootStrap files
- BootStrap footer
- Images showing in thumbnails on blog's main page
- Showing newest blogs added on top
- Ability to update a blog
- Ability to delete a blog
- Only the user whose the author of the blog can update or delete it
- Improved styling

You can compare the differences between the blog in the tutorial and my repo from the video titled Django Tutorial #1
from time 1:41 onwards. Massive credits to The Net Ninja for making this tutorial:
